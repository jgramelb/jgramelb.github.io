On the side, I am exploring software development, database design, visualizing data by taking Coursera courses by the University of Michigan. I'd like to someday go back to school for Computer Science and marry my passion in insurance and love for technology. I obtained my B.A. in both Mathematics and German from University of Hawaii at Manoa in May 2018. <br> Disclaimer: This page is still under construction!</br> ",
